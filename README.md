Touch and changes

prompt => digit for changing value
+/- for changing mode

TODO (v2) :

- mapping for Races/Ethnics
- commands (for now only +/- are working)
- add the possibility to handle properly summons and all
- add the possibility to add multiple entity at once (likely for summons etc) with random nicknames
